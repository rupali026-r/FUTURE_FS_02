# Weather Dashboard (Task 2)

## Overview

This project is a dynamic Weather Dashboard web application that allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city or region. Users can also save their favorite cities for quick access. This project was built as part of a learning task focused on API integration, dynamic data handling, and frontend design.

## Key Features

- **Search by City/Region:** Users can input a city or region name to retrieve weather information.
- **Current Weather Display:** Shows the current temperature and humidity for the searched location.
- **5-Day Forecast:** Provides a detailed 5-day weather forecast.
- **Save Favorite Cities:** Users can save cities to a list for quick access in future sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap (for fetching weather data)
- **Dependencies (Backend):** axios, cors, dotenv

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd your-weather-dashboard
````

**2. Backend Setup:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY
PORT=5000
```

Replace `YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

**3. Frontend Setup:**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

1.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Use the search bar to enter the name of a city or region and click "Search".
3.  The dashboard will display the current weather and a 5-day forecast for the searched location.
4.  To save a city as a favorite, click the "Save to Favorites" button on the current weather display.
5.  Your favorite cities will be listed in the "Favorite Cities" section. You can load the weather for a saved city by clicking the "Load" button next to it, or remove it from your favorites by clicking "Remove".

## Skills Gained

This project helped in gaining practical experience and understanding of:

  - **API Integration:** Connecting the frontend and backend to external APIs (OpenWeatherMap).
  - **Dynamic Data Handling:** Managing and displaying data fetched from APIs using React.js.
  - **Frontend Development with React.js:** Building a user interface with components, state management, and event handling.
  - **Backend Development with Node.js and Express.js:** Setting up API endpoints and handling server-side logic.
  - **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Working with Promises and `async/await` for API calls.
  - **Basic Styling with CSS:** Creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
  - **Environment Variable Management:** Securely handling API keys using `.env` files.

## Screenshots

**(Note: Replace `path/to/screenshot*.png` with the actual paths to your screenshots.)**

## Further Improvements

  - Implement more detailed forecast information (e.g., wind speed, pressure).
  - Add visual indicators for weather conditions (icons).
  - Implement user interface enhancements and styling improvements.
  - Explore caching mechanisms to reduce API calls.
  - Implement location services to automatically detect the user's current location.
